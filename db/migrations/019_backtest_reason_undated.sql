-- Backtesting comes back: its own reason, and no date needed.
--
-- 'Backtest (FX Replay)' never stopped being a legal account (012 kept it in
-- the CHECK), so offering it again needs nothing here. Two things do:
--
--   reason 'Backtest replay'   "Why did you take it?" for a replayed trade —
--                              offered on Backtest only, so backtests gather
--                              in their own group on the whiteboard instead of
--                              joining the real A+ and B clusters.
--
--   undated                    1 = the day is unknown. A backtest from a chart
--                              months back has no date worth typing, and a
--                              made-up one would put it on a calendar day, in
--                              a weekday heatmap and in a streak where it never
--                              was. `date` still holds a timestamp — when it
--                              was logged — so backtests keep the order they
--                              were done in and nothing that sorts by date
--                              meets a NULL. Only Backtest can be undated
--                              (lib/validate.ts).
--
-- A CHECK cannot be altered in place, so the table is rebuilt as in 014-016.
-- The definition below is the live one (018's three ALTER-added columns
-- included) with the reason list and `undated` changed; every column is
-- copied, the generated ones recompute, and the indexes and all three
-- triggers are restored exactly as they were.

 * Storing an OFFSET rather than an absolute position means the arrangement
 * survives a group growing, shrinking, or being re-sorted: the grid moves the
 * group and your nudge moves with it.
 *
 * Keyed by grouping mode too, because "where I put the Revenge pile" is a fact
 * about the board organised by reason and means nothing when it is organised by

/**
 * Moving between screens, animated.
 *
 * The App Router swaps a page out the instant the next one arrives, so a page
 * can animate in but never out — tabs cut rather than move, and the New trade
 * window vanished on close instead of closing. The View Transitions API fixes
 * both: the browser keeps a picture of the old screen, the new one renders
 * underneath, and the two are animated against each other.
 *
 * Every internal link and every programmatic navigation goes through here:
 * <NavTransitions/> catches link clicks, and code calls navigate(). Only a
 * change of screen animates — a filter or a month (same path, new query)
 * swaps in place, because a fade on every filter click is a fade too many.
 *
 * Three shapes, all subtle, all with a little spring at the end:
 *   page    the old screen fades out quickly, the new one rises in 8px with a
 *           faint overshoot. The whiteboard only fades — it is the one screen
 *           that must never be seen to move.
 *   open    the New trade window rises and scales up from just below.
 *   close   it sinks and shrinks away as the board fades back in.
 *
 * Reduced motion (the setting or the OS) skips all of it.

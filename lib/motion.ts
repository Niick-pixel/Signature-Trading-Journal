  Tuned bouncy — subtly.

  Damping ratio ζ = damping / (2·√(stiffness·mass)) decides the character:
  1 arrives and stops, lower overshoots and settles back. The app used to sit
  at 0.75–1, which read as calm but inert. These sit at about 0.6–0.7 —
  a 5–8% overshoot that reads as a little give, the way a good physical
  switch feels — with the bounciest (0.55) kept for small things that should
  feel alive: toggles, checks, the grade badge.

  Two stay near-critical on purpose: springSize, because a height or width
  that overshoots makes the content below it jump; and springLayout, because
  the whiteboard is the one surface that must never be seen to wobble.

  Overshoot for a given ζ is e^(−ζπ/√(1−ζ²)): ζ 0.55 ≈ 13%, 0.65 ≈ 7%, 0.7 ≈ 5%.

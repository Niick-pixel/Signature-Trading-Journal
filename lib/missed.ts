/**
 * Where you freeze.
 *
 * A missed trade on its own is an anecdote; the question worth answering is
 * whether the misses cluster — on a setup, in a session, after a loss, on a
 * rattled morning. So every missed trade is set against the trades you DID
 * take under the same condition, and each condition gets a miss rate: of the
 * setups you saw there, how many went without you.
 *
 * A rate is compared with your usual one, never read alone: missing 30% of
 * London setups means nothing if you miss 30% of everything. The sentences at
 * the top only name a condition when it is clearly above the usual AND has
 * enough setups behind it that the difference is not four trades of luck.

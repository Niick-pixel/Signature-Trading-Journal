// Where the journal lives, and how that is decided.
//
// Three ways Signature runs, three answers:
//
//   from source      ./data beside the code, always.
//   portable .exe    a data/ folder beside the executable, so a copy on a USB
//                    stick carries its journal with it (unchanged).
//   installed        a folder YOU chose, remembered in location.json in the
//                    app's own settings folder. An installer replaces the
//                    program folder on every update, so the journal can never
//                    live there — and it is asked for rather than assumed,
//                    because this is the folder worth backing up.
//
// Nothing here imports Electron: the dialogs are handed in, so every branch
// can be tested with plain Node.
